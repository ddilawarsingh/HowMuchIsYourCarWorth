Multiple regression is arguably the single most important method in all of statistics. Regression models are widely used in many disciplines. In addition, a good understanding of regression is all but essential for understanding many other, more sophisticated statistical methods.

This Project consists of a set of activities that will enabled to build a multivariate regression model. The model will be used to describe the relationship between the retail price of 2005 used GM cars and various car characteristics, such as mileage, make, model, presence or absence of cruise control, and engine size. The set of activities in this project allowed to work through the entire process of model building and assessment, including
1. Applying variable selection techniques
2. Using residual plots to check for violations of model assumptions, such as heteroskedasticity, outliers, and non-normality distributed errors
3. Transforming data to better fit model assumptions
4. Understanding the impact of correlated explanatory variables
5. Incorporating categorical explanatory variables into a regression model

In this project, I have used a relatively small subset of the Kelley Blue Book database to describe the association of several explanatory variables (car characteristics) with the retail value of a car. The data set Cars contains the make, model, equipment, mileage, and Kelley Blue Book suggested retail price of several used 2005 GM cars.
